# **Code of Conduct**

Songcamp is committed to fostering a friendly, safe, comfortable and collaborative environment for all gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, age, or level of experience.

We invite all those who participate in the Songcamp ecosystem (Elektra, BPM and Labs included) to help create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## **Our Goal**

The goal of this Code of Conduct is to set the overall tone for our community and to provide a guide and a process by which we interact and hold each other accountable. 

This isn't an exhaustive list of things you can and can't do. But rather an invitation for our community members to move towards **being their best selves**. We want to cultivate a culture that is healthy, hospitable, collaborative and creative.

### **Expected Behaviors:**

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- Being kind and courteous to others. Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language. Acknowledging preferred gender pronouns. Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Being respectful of different viewpoints and experiences.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Approaching and listening to others in good faith and leading with empathy.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Having the community’s best interest at heart.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community stewards if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
- Remember that IRL community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

### **Unacceptable Behaviors:**

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

- Implicitly or explicitly offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, or age.
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
- Disregarding preferred gender pronouns, or use of 'dead' or rejected names.
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or messages, including the use of explicit or violent sexual language colloquially.
- Unwanted simulated physical contact (e.g. textual descriptions like "hug" or "backrub").
- Threats or incitement of violence of any kind, including encouraging an individual to engage in self-harm.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.
- Harassment, including persistent attempts to communicate with someone (publicly or privately) after requests are ignored or otherwise declined.
- Publication of private communication (e.g. screenshots of personal exchanges) or private personal information (e.g. name, location, identifying details).”Doxing”.
